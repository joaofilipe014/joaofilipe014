- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy playing futsal, running, reading, and especially watching movies and TV series. I like learning new things—especially when i truly understand them and not just go through the motions. I also really enjoy going out, grabbing a coffee in the afternoon now and then. It's always nice to spend time with the people I care about.
